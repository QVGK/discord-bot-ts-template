  Discord TS Template is a Discord bot template that utilizes [SapphireJS](https://www.sapphirejs.dev/), a better alternative to DiscordJS.

### Why Sapphire and not DiscordJS?

I've chosen to use Sapphire as it has great Typescript support out of the box, and there's no need to create a command or event handler as *it just works*.

### Is Sapphire easier than DiscordJS?

Personally, I would say that it is. They have a great documentation that explains everything quite thoroughly, and they have "Plugins" to help improve your work flow.
